    "  I started having my son Jacob take private lesson's with Chris last year.  
    My son's confidence reached an all time high after doing the  weekly sessions.  
    His hitting, fielding and pitching all improved drastically.  
    Jacob is a completely different player out there now.  
    Chris has state of the art equipment and a great knowledge of the game of baseball.  
    He is extremely patient with the kids and brings a fun yet productive approach to his training session's.  
    I recomend Chris Singleton to anyone who is looking to see fast results and improvement in their childs development. "
